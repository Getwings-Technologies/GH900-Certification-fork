Start a agent session and prompt - 
```text
we will be improving the documentation of our project. Please create a checklist issue in our GitHub repository with the following tasks: Update README with clearer setup instructions, Add a Getting Started page to the Wiki, Review and improve existing documentation, Add contribution guidelines. Make sure to include an overview, goals, and notes section in the issue.
```

also can try this simple query: "improve documentation in readme file"

also talk about how you can steer the agent mid task by asking questions in the inline chat or using certain inline commands to guide the agent's actions. For example, you can ask the agent to explain a certain part of the code, suggest improvements, generate tests, or provide documentation. This allows for a more interactive and dynamic way to collaborate with the agent while it is working on a task.
