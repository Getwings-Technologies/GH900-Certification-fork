# Lab – GitHub Gists: Share and Reuse Code Snippets

## Scenario
You want to quickly share a small piece of code or text with a teammate without creating a full GitHub repository.

GitHub Gists allow you to share lightweight snippets that can be public or secret and easily reused.

In this lab, you will create and update a GitHub Gist.

## Lab Objectives
By completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Understand what GitHub Gists are
- Create a public GitHub Gist
- Add and edit content in a Gist
- Share a Gist using a URL

---

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Web browser
- Basic understanding of text files

---

## Step 1: Understand GitHub Gists
A GitHub Gist is:
- A lightweight way to share code or text
- Not a full repository
- Ideal for small examples, scripts, or notes

Gists can be:
- Public (visible to everyone)
- Secret (only accessible via link)

---

## Step 2: Review the Starter File
Open the following file locally:

```text
Labs/lab-git-basics/sample-gist-snippet.txt
```

This file contains a simple code snippet that you will use to create your Gist.
