## Discussion Title:

-How should contributors update project documentation?


## Discussion Body:

## Question
What is the recommended way for contributors to update project documentation in this repository?

---

## Background
This project uses GitHub features such as repositories, Wikis, and Pull Requests to manage documentation.
New contributors often ask how they should propose documentation changes.

---

## What We’re Looking For
- Recommended workflow for documentation updates
- When to use Pull Requests vs direct edits
- Any best practices contributors should follow

---

## Goal
Provide clear guidance so contributors can confidently update documentation while following the project’s collaboration standards.


### Sample Reply:

Thanks for the question!

The recommended approach is:
1. Make documentation changes locally or in a forked repository
2. Commit the changes with a clear message
3. Open a Pull Request for review

For larger documentation updates or structural changes, it’s a good idea to open a Discussion or Issue first to gather feedback before submitting a Pull Request.
